I assert that all work done is my own, except for one thing see down below.

I obtained a snippet of code form stackoverflow in the DBMonster class. 
On line 39 in that class there is a line of code used for splitting a string
based off of delimeters. It turns out, I don't need it for my purposes but it works so im keeping it.
Please know I did not write that code, it is retrieved from the link pasted in 
the comment in that file. It is not my own code.

The bonus parts i did for this assignment include:
    CSS Style Sheets (10 marks)
    Database for Monster lists (20 marks)
    Editing for Monster Database (20 marks)

for a total of 50 possible bonus marks.
